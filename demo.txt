📄 Description:
This video demonstrates the final project for the B032430 (B255) - DATA COLLECTION AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR CRITICAL CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS 2024-2025 at the University of Florence. It showcases a real-time anomaly detection system running on a standalone laptop. The project monitors CPU, memory, and I/O usage to detect anomalous system behavior using a trained machine learning model.

🛠️ Steps demonstrated in the video:
1. Launching the system monitor
2. Simulating anomalies using `injector.py`
3. Viewing the collected dataset and labeling
4. Training the model
5. Running the real-time anomaly detector
6. Detecting anomalies live
